# todo
* [ ] when using bulk ips - instead of it... freezing for a while, then redirecting to a 200 json, use the modals
* [ ] scratch the top todo, just make it so it never sends you to the json, but just returns the message in a modal
* [ ] sort rich rules by ports, by ips, if they are dropped, if they rejected
* [ ] make the actions delete the correct rich rule

# bugs 
* [ ] if there are too many rich rules, the header disappears and you cant access it anymore, make the table scrollable
